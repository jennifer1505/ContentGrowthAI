üß™ Take-Home Assignment: AI-Powered Marketing Content Pipeline
üß† Objective
Build a lightweight, automated marketing pipeline that generates, distributes, and optimizes blog and newsletter content using AI and CRM integrations.
Your system should:
Ideate and generate content (e.g., blog + newsletter copy) using an AI model.
Distribute that content to a targeted audience through a marketing CRM (like HubSpot or a similar platform).
Collect and analyze engagement data to inform future content optimizations.
The end goal:
A well-greased, mostly hands-free AI pipeline for producing highly targeted and customizable marketing content that continuously improves based on performance metrics. This could be hosted on a website or just be a program run on your local machine.

üß≠ Scenario
You‚Äôre the Content & Growth Analyst for NovaMind, a fictional early-stage AI startup that helps small creative agencies automate their daily workflows (think Notion + Zapier + ChatGPT combined).
NovaMind wants to grow inbound traffic and newsletter conversions using AI-assisted content. The company publishes one weekly blog about automation trends, then promotes it via personalized newsletters segmented by audience type:
Founders / Decision-Makers (focus on ROI, growth, efficiency)
Creative Professionals (focus on inspiration, time-saving tools)
Operations Managers (focus on workflows, integrations, reliability)
Your task: design and implement an AI content automation system that takes a blog idea all the way through to newsletter distribution and performance reporting.

üõ† Requirements
1. AI Content Generation
Build a process that can:
Take a topic input (e.g., ‚ÄúAI in creative automation‚Äù) and generate:
A blog post outline and short-form draft (‚âà 400‚Äì600 words).
Three short newsletter versions of that blog, each customized for a different persona.
Use any language model (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, etc.) via API or SDK.
Store the generated content in a structured format (JSON, Markdown, or CMS entry).

2. CRM + Newsletter Distribution
Integrate your system with HubSpot (or a similar CRM if you prefer).
Your automation should:
Create or update contacts in your CRM (mock data is fine).
Tag or segment contacts by persona.
Send out the appropriate newsletter version to each persona segment.
Log each campaign (blog title, newsletter ID, send date) to your CRM.
üí° You can sign up for a HubSpot free developer or trial account or similar service and send API calls with test data ‚Äî please show realistic endpoint usage and payload structure.

3. Performance Logging & Analysis
After ‚Äúsending‚Äù your campaign, your system should:
Fetch or simulate newsletter performance data (open rate, click rate, unsubscribe rate, etc.).
Store the data for historical comparison.
Generate a brief AI-powered performance summary (e.g., ‚ÄúCreative Professionals had a 12% higher click rate. Recommend using more visual case studies next time.‚Äù).

4. Optional Bonus Features
Add AI-driven content optimization (e.g., suggest next blog topics or headlines based on engagement trends).
Add multiple options for copy and content with the ability to add revisions and suggestions.
Build a simple dashboard or web UI to view and trigger the workflow.
üì¶ Deliverables
Submit the following:
GitHub repo (or similar) containing your code and documentation.
README or design doc explaining:
Architecture overview and flow diagram
Tools, APIs, and models used
Assumptions made (e.g., mocked data, simulated responses)
Instructions to run locally
(Optional) Short Loom/demo video walking through your pipeline
